# Results of the expert survey {#sec-survey-results}

In this section we provide the results of the expert survey, mainly the results of the prioritization process.
We present these in terms of three scenarios.
The scenarios are motivated by a species selection entertained by the agency for nature and forest of the Flemish government (Agentschap voor Natuur en Bos; ANB) and/or by foci on the different monitoring scopes.
Each scenario thus comprises a subset of the total set of species covered by the survey.
The scenarios and corresponding species subsets are:

- Scenario 1: Species that ANB considers important in terms of management; this implies a focus on the management-related monitoring scopes 
- Scenario 2: Focus on species for which the monitoring scope detection is (also) relevant
- Scenario 3: Focus on species for which the monitoring scope distribution is (also) relevant

As will be seen in the following, there is substantial overlap between the species subsets corresponding to scenarios 1 and 3.
The species subset considered in scenario 2 is rather unique and thus complementary to the scenario 1 and 3 subsets.
The latter is, in parts, due to our choice of assigning scope relevance based on invasion stadium (see @sec-prior). 

Results for the full set of species the survey provides data on are included in appendix X.
This concerns the prioritization results (ref appendix section) but also a number of descriptive results (ref appendix section) *[re-use [these figures](file:///G:/Gedeelde%20drives/PRJ_MIUS/github/mias-general/output/survey_experts/survey_results.html)]*.
To give some insight into which species we indeed have data on, we first briefly describe the response rate in the following.

## Response rate

Of the 120 questionnaires `r n_questionnaires` were completed for `r n_species` species.
Among these species are `r n_species_unionlist` IAS of union concern and `r n_species_rest` additional species.
To see for which species survey responses are available consult again @tbl-species.
In the overview table, species entries are greyed out if the survey was sent out but not completed.

## Scenario 1: ANB focus species {#sec-scenario-1}

The first scenario considered concerns species deemed important by ANB and implies a focus on management and the corresponding monitoring scopes. 
It can concern species from all invasion stadia.

### Prioritization of species

@tbl-priorplantsanb and @tbl-prioranimalsanb display the results of the survey-based prioritization process for the ANB focus plants and animals respectively. 
The tables are sorted as follows:
First, rows are sorted by monitoring scope priority (stage 2 of prioritization process), with high priority scopes on top.
Within (i.e., for each value of) scope priority, rows are sorted by scope type relying on the order: `r table_base_upd$scope_type |> levels()`.
That is, within high and low priority scopes, all species for which (at least) detection is relevant appear first, 
followed by those for which (at least) inventory is relevant and so forth.
Within (i.e., for each value of) scope type, rows are sorted by milieu according to the order: `r table_base_upd$prius_milieu |> levels()`.
Within (i.e., for each value of) milieu, rows are sorted by invasion stadium, from "absent" to "widely established".
Within (i.e., for each value of) invasion stadium, rows are sorted by global feasibility scores from high to low.

For about `r round(n_species_anb_prior$plant / n_species_anb$plant * 100)`% of the plants and about `r round(n_species_anb_prior$animal / n_species_anb$animal * 100)`% of the animals comprising this scenario at least one monitoring scope is withheld during prioritization.
The respective plants are: 

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
names_anb_prior$plant |> 
    paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
    cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

The respective animals are:

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
names_anb_prior$animal |> 
    paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
    cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

The three most prominent reasons for exclusion during stage 2 of the prioritization process are for the plants (multiple exclusion criteria can apply per species-scope combination) *[change frequencies to relative]*:

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
anb_exclusion$plant |> 
  dplyr::pull("reason") |>
  paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
  cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

For the animals these are: 

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
anb_exclusion$animal |> 
  dplyr::pull("reason") |>
  paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
  cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

*[Note: I can add such an overview also for stage 1, if interesting enough? Also conditional overview only for on scope under focus?]*

```{r table prior plants anb}
#| label: tbl-priorplantsanb
#| tbl-cap: Prioritized and nonprioritized species-scope combinations for ANB focus plants

table_filtered_anb_display_list$plant

```

```{r table prior animals anb}
#| label: tbl-prioranimalsanb
#| tbl-cap: Prioritized and nonprioritized species-scope combinations for ANB focus animals

table_filtered_anb_display_list$animal

```

### Method-based synergies

@tbl-synplantsanb1, @tbl-synanimalsanb1, and @tbl-synanimalsanb2 show the method-based synergies for the ANB focus plants and animals. Here, we only consider the monitoring scopes under focus, hence distribution under management and abundance under management. 
The tables are structured such that primary, secondary and tertiary species are presented in groups of rows.
Reported monitoring methods are arranged in columns and table cells are filled with color when a method was reported for a species.   
Within species groups, rows are sorted by milieu according to the order: `r table_base_upd$prius_milieu |> levels()`.

For the ANB focus plants, the scope distribution under management is mostly irrelevant or, in one case, is relevant but gets assigned a low priority. 
For scope abundance after management, on the other hand, a clear group emerges. 
It consists of five (partly) freshwater plants, all of which can all be monitored using visual surveys and four of which can be monitored using aquatic environmental DNA.
There are only primary species in this case.


```{r table-syn-plants-anb-1}
#| label: tbl-synplantsanb1
#| tbl-cap: Method-based synergies for ANB focus plants under scope abundance after management
table_syn_anb_plants_display_list$abundance_management
```

Turning to the ANB focus animals, both management-related scopes are relevant and of high priority.
For scope distribution under management, there is a potential synergy between coypu (Dutch vernacular name: beverrat) *[switch to english vernacular names consistently?]* and common raccoon (Dutch vernacular name: wasbeer) as a free rider, as both can be monitored with camera traps and visual surveys.
However, this synergy appears to be unrealistic due to significant habitat/milieu differences between the species.

For scope abundance under management, two small groups form, both involving the Chinese muntjac (Dutch: Chinese muntjak).
In combination with the common raccoon (Dutch: wasbeer) method-based synergies concern visual surveys and camera traps.
In combination with the African clawed frog (Dutch: Afrikaanse klauwkikker) method-based synergies visual surveys and passive acoustic monitoring.

```

#| label: tbl-synanimalsanb2
#| tbl-cap: Method-based synergies for ANB focus animals under scope abundance after management
table_syn_anb_animals_display_list$abundance_management
```



## Scenario 2: Focus on monitoring scope detection

The focus on the monitoring scope detection under this second scenario is motivated by the acknowledged importance and effectiveness of early interventions in combating biological invasions (ref).
It can concern absent and sporadically present species, but also widespread species absent from conservation areas, as we consider the detection relevant for these species groups (see @sec-prior).

Also the IAS regulation highlights the role of early detection and rapid response (see @sec-scopes).
At the same time, it is determined that early detection and rapid response to a substantial extent concern official inspections such as border controls, which are within the reponsibilities of the Federal authorities [see @sec-terminology; @working_group_on_invasive_alien_species_surveillance_2017]. 
Monitoring coordinated by INBO would under this scenario mainly be devoted to detecting introductions into nature (alternative ref to [link](https://www.health.belgium.be/en/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/invasive-alien-species/anchoring-international-level-implementation)).

To render monitoring feasible, however, potential places of introduction into nature should be sufficiently known and specific. 
In addition, introduction into conservation areas should be a matter of concern in the sense that a species is not yet present and expected to have an impact.
These aspects therefore feature as exclusion criteria in the prioritization process (see @sec-prior).

### Prioritization of species

@tbl-priorplantsdet and @tbl-prioranimalsdet display the results of the survey-based prioritization process for the plants and animals, respectively, for which monitoring scope detection is (also) relevant.
The tables are sorted as under scenario 1.

For about `r round(n_species_det_prior$plant / n_species_det$plant * 100)`% of the plants and about `r round(n_species_det_prior$animal / n_species_det$animal * 100)`% of the animals comprising this scenario at least one monitoring scope is withheld during prioritization.
The respective plants are: 

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
names_det_prior$plant |> 
    paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
    cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

The respective animals are:

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
names_det_prior$animal |> 
    paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
    cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

The three most prominent reasons for exclusion during stage 2 of the prioritization process are for the plants:

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
det_exclusion$plant |> 
  dplyr::pull("reason") |>
  paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
  cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

For the animals these are: 

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
det_exclusion$animal |> 
  dplyr::pull("reason") |>
  paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
  cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```


```{r table prior plants det}
#| label: tbl-priorplantsdet
#| tbl-cap: Prioritized and nonprioritized species-scope combinations for plants for which detection is relevant
#| 
table_filtered_det_display_list$plant

```

```{r table prior animals det}
#| label: tbl-prioranimalsdet
#| tbl-cap: Prioritized and nonprioritized species-scope combinations for animals for which detection is relevant

table_filtered_det_display_list$animal

```


### Method-based synergies

@tbl-synplantsdet1 and @table-synanimalsdet1 show the method-based synergies for plants and animals for which detection is relevant. 
Here we only consider the monitoring scope detection. 
The tables are structured as under scenario 1.

For plants we find visual surveys to be recommended for a group of four partly terrestrial species.
This group consists of three primary and one secondary species.

```{r table-syn-plants-det-1}
#| label: tbl-synplantsdet1
#| tbl-cap: Method-based synergies for plants under scope detection 
table_syn_det_plants_display_list$detection
```

Turning to the animals, two larger groups arise:
The first, aquatic group encompasses three fish species (Dutch vernacular names: Zwarte amerikaanse dwergmeerval, Amurgrondel, Blauwband) and the muskrat (Dutch: Muskusrat) as primary species as well as the signal crayfish (Dutch: Californische rivierkreeft) and the flat‐bottomed star (Dutch: Noord-atlantische zeester) as secondary species.
Aquatic environmental DNA qualifies as a group-wide monitoring method suited for detection. 
Electric fishing, trapping and netting can in addition be used for the subgroup of fish.

The second group comprises a number of primary (Dutch vernacular names: Muskusrat, Indische mangoeste, Axishert, Huiskraai), secondary (Dutch vernacular names: Kuifmaina, Treurmaina, Asian needle ant, Zwarte vuurmier, Dwergvuurmier), and tertiary (Dutch vernacular names: Pallas eekhoorn, Nieuwzeelandse platworm) terrestrial species. 
For this large group synergies arise in terms of the potential use of visual surveys, camera traps for the subgroup of mammals, and acoustic surveys for the subgroup of birds.
A group-wide synergy in terms of visual surveys seems rather unrealistic given the heterogenous taxa involved (i.e., visual surveys for mammals are a very different matter for insects as compared to worms).

```{r table-syn-animals-det-1}
#| label: tbl-synanimalsdet1
#| tbl-cap: Method-based synergies for animals under scope detection 
table_syn_det_animals_display_list$detection
```


## Scenario 3: Focus on monitoring scope distribution

The third scenario focuses on the monitoring scope distribution motivated by the clear requirement of the IAS regulation to report on the distribution of already established IAS (see @sec-scopes).
It concerns species spread to a limited extend as well as widespread species, since we consider the scope distribution relevant for these species groups (see @sec-prior).


### Prioritization of species

@tbl-priorplantsdist and @tbl-prioranimalsdist display the results of the survey-based prioritization process for the plants and animals, respectively, for which the monitoring scope distribution is (also) relevant.
The tables are sorted as under scenario 1.

For about `r round(n_species_dist_prior$plant / n_species_dist$plant * 100)`% of the plants and about `r round(n_species_dist_prior$animal / n_species_dist$animal * 100)`% of the animals comprising this scenario at least one monitoring scope is withheld during prioritization.
The respective plants are: 

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
names_dist_prior$plant |> 
    paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
    cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

The respective animals are:

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
names_dist_prior$animal |> 
    paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
    cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

The three most prominent reasons for exclusion during stage 2 of the prioritization process are for the plants:

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
dist_exclusion$plant |> 
  dplyr::pull("reason") |>
  paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
  cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```

For the animals these are: 

```{r }
#| results: "asis"
dist_exclusion$animal |> 
  dplyr::pull("reason") |>
  paste(x = "  -", y = _) |>
  cat(x = _, sep = "\n")
```


```{r table prior plants dist}

```


```{r table prior animals dist}
#| label: tbl-prioranimalsdist
#| tbl-cap: Prioritized and nonprioritized species-scope combinations for animals for which distribution is relevant

table_filtered_dist_display_list$animal

```

### Method-based synergies

@tbl-synplantsdist1 and @table-synanimalsdsit2 show the method-based synergies for plants and animals for which the monitoring scope distribution is relevant. 
The tables are structured as under scenario 1.

For plants we find the same aquatic group as under scenario 1 with the same method-based synergies, visual surveys and aquatic environmental DNA.


```{r table-syn-plants-dist-1}
#| label: tbl-synplantsdist1
#| tbl-cap: Method-based synergies for plants under scope distribution 
table_syn_dist_plants_display_list$distribution
```

For the animals, two groups emerge.
A first, terrestrial group comprises two primary mammals (Dutch vernacular names: Aziatische grondeekhoorn, Chinese muntjak)
and a tertiary mammal (Dutch: wasbeer), all of which can be monitored using visual surveys and camera traps.

A second, aquatic group consists of four primary species (Dutch vernacular names: Afrikaanse klauwkikker, blauwband, beverrat, muskusrat), a secondary crayfish (Dutch: gevlekte rivierkreeft) and a tertiary species (Dutch: Chinese krab), sharing aquatic environmental DNA as a monitoring method.

Note that for the majority of these species (i.e., Chinese muntjac, African clawed frog, coypu, and common raccoon) method-based synergies were already found under scenario 1.


```{r table-syn-animals-dist-1}
#| label: tbl-synanimalsdist1
#| tbl-cap: Method-based synergies for animals under scope distribution 
table_syn_dist_animals_display_list$distribution
```

## Caveats

In the current analysis we have not established the evaluation of early eradication measures as its own monitoring scope distinct from the scope detection. 
<!--
[Alternatively we could have considered the included management-related scopes for absent/sporadically present species, but that sounds a bit counterintuitive.]
-->
*[Note: The discussion in the context of the muntjac monitoring and specifically Tim mentioning the evaluation of early eradication made me realize that this got a bit lost in this analysis, as we mainly focused on management of established species.]*
Had we done this, then the analysis of method-based synergies under scenario 1 could have been extended by one further management-related monitoring scope, in theory. 
In practice, we would not have seen much change in the results, as 5 out of 6 plants and 16 out of 17 animals for which detection is relevant are not withheld during the survey-based prioritization process.
This is due to the relatively strict exclusion criteria employed in relation to the monitoring scope detection (see @sec-prior).
These would likewise have applied to species-scope combinations involving the downstream monitoring scope of management related to detection.

Speaking about the exclusion criteria employed in relation to scope detection, another concern might be that we tied the scope's relevance to
the invasion stadia of species being absent, sporadically present, or widespread but absent from conservation areas.
The stadium established to a limited extend was not taken into account.
The reason for this is that, due to the generic nature of the current analysis, we did not consider species-specific 
distribution areas based on which we could have defined areas relevant for monitoring for detection. 
A more in-depth analysis for a single or a smaller group of limited established IAS might reveal such additional areas.
