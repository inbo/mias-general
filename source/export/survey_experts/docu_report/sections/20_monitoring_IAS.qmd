# Monitoring schemes for invasive alien species in Flanders: Some background {#sec-monitoring-ias}

## The legal context {#sec-legal-context}

### The EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation

At the level of the EU, legislation on IAS is bundled in the Invasive Alien Species Regulation [@noauthor_regulation_2014]. The regulation applies to a list of 88 IAS of Union concern, which is subject to regular extensions [@noauthor_commission_2016; @noauthor_commission_2017; @noauthor_commission_2019; @noauthor_commission_2022]. For species on the Union List EU member states are, among other things, required to setup a "surveillance system" that allows "for early detection of new invasive alien species and for the determination of the distribution of already established species" [@noauthor_regulation_2014, p. 4], as well as for monitoring the effectiveness of measures of (early) eradication, population control or containment [@noauthor_regulation_2014, pp. 16-17].

The Invasive Alien Species Regulation and The Commission Implementing Regulation on the formats for reporting under the Invasive Alien Species Regulation [@noauthor_commission_2024] further specify the following reporting obligations in relation to the surveillance system: a species' distribution; the effectiveness and side effects of early eradication measures; the effectiveness and side effects of management measures.

The reporting obligation regarding the species' distribution foremost concerns the distribution status in the form of distribution maps [@noauthor_commission_2024, pp. 3-4].
In addition, information on the reproductive status (e.g., does a self-sustaining population exist?), the reproductive pattern (e.g., sexual pattern), the introduction (e.g., how was the species predominantly introduced during the reporting period?) and spread patterns (e.g., did the species predominantly disperse through natural dispersal?) is also considered a relevant aspect of distribution and should be supplied if available.

The effectiveness of early eradication measures and the effectiveness of management measures (i.e., eradication, control, containment) are both to be reported in terms of long- or short-term effects on the presence of a species or on numbers of individuals [@noauthor_commission_2024, p. 7, 10]. To this end, a few categorical response choices are offered (e.g., complete and permanent eradication, partial eradication, no reduction in numbers). Side effects are to be reported in terms of the presence of negative effects on the environment, non-targeted species, or human health.


### Legislation in Flanders

At the Flemish level, the Decree of the Flemish Government on the Protection and Management of Species, or, in short, the Species Decree, specifies that INBO "(...) shall coordinate the inventory of species falling within the scope of this Decree, with regard to: monitoring the state of conservation of native species; drawing up red lists concerning native species (...); monitoring the status of invasive species and potentially invasive species" [@noauthor_decree_2009; article 5, notes to article 5; pp. XX].^[Note that this and all following quotes represent unofficial translations of the original Dutch text.]

Inventorying is thereby defined as "establishing the occurrence of certain species in certain areas of the Flemish region, at certain time points and in certain numbers".
It is further specified that the "emphasis lies on aspects of distribution, abundance changes over time (...) with regard to (...) control and the prevention of nuisance.
Monitoring in turn is defined as inventorying in a "standardized and regular manner" allowing for the determination of trends with regard to the respective species. 
It is highlighted that inventory obligations originate in European legislation.

The "coordinating role" assigned to INBO concerns ensuring the "correct collection, processing and interpretation of data" while individual volunteers as well as volunteers from various associations and organizations might contribute to carrying out data collection in the field.


## Surveillance and monitoring: A clarification of terms

Although used recurrently, the terms “surveillance” and “monitoring” are not explicitly defined, neither in the Invasive Alien Species Regulation nor in the Species Decree. We therefore include a brief clarification of terms in this section.


### Surveillance and monitoring in EU terms {#sec-terms-eu}

In the supporting document Surveillance of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern [@working_group_on_invasive_alien_species_surveillance_2017] available via [an official EU website](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/nature-and-biodiversity/invasive-alien-species_en) document surveillance is defined as "a systematic activity or survey of entry points for IAS aimed at detecting, identifying and locating alien species new to the EU, to a Member State (...). As such, surveillance is an integral and pivotal element of early detection, early warning and rapid response and of prevention. IAS surveillance may include the adaptation or extension of existing programmes that are called ‘monitoring’. Inspection may be considered a form of directed surveillance. Inspection is an official and systematic activity focused on IAS pathways and entry points or invasion hubs aimed at detecting deliberate or inadvertent introduction of IAS." [@working_group_on_invasive_alien_species_surveillance_2017, p. 5].

Hence, surveillance in the EU sense pertains to the detection of previously absent IAS, via biodiversity monitoring but also official inspections. 

Monitoring on the other hand is defined more broadly as "the systematic collection of data over time and space to track changes. In the IAS context this means assessing trends in new biological invasions, tracking the invasion progress of a species, or tracking biological responses to implemented actions, including eradication and control" [@working_group_on_invasive_alien_species_surveillance_2017, p. 5].


### Surveillance and monitoring in this report

In the current report, we employ “monitoring” as an umbrella term with a definition largely overlapping with the one in the above-cited EU document. Note however that, according to our use, monitoring can also be implemented for the purpose of detection, but does then obviously not incorporate official inspections. We find that a more in-depth definition is not required in the current stage. 

However, as we also aim to prepare future applications of the INBO guidelines for monitoring schemes we already point out that these handle different, more nuanced definitions of monitoring and surveillance. In the guidelines - but also in the scientific literature on nature conservation - surveillance concerns repeated and standardized measurements in order to assess the status and/or trend of a certain target, in the present context for instance the distribution of an IAS. Monitoring in turn is defined as a special form of surveillance in that it involves a-priori defined standards for the evaluation of the target’s status and/or trend [@wouters_ontwerp_2008-1, pp. 15 - 16; @alexander_survey_2008, p. 49]. Following this logic, we might, alternatively, have used “surveillance” as our umbrella term. In fact, we still were when designing the survey, which is why the raw survey materials provided in @sec-app-a feature the term “surveillance” instead of “monitoring”. Switching terms is obviously not ideal but the benefits seemed to outweigh the costs as the EU-aligned definition of surveillance is rather common among IAS experts and in communication with policy-makers.


### Monitoring schemes according to this report

With “monitoring schemes” we refer to schemes that have been designed following a principled methodology to ensure that data collection is purposeful and optimized to meet numerical quality criteria. 
Such schemes give rise to objective, reliable and valid results that are fit for informing policy. 
The INBO guidelines for designing policy-oriented monitoring schemes [@wouters_ontwerp_2008-1] represent such a methodology aimed at tailoring 
monitoring objectives, data collection, processing and analysis, reporting and quality control to the true information needs.

More specifically, a systematic, five-phase approach is proposed.
The guidelines thereby emphasize the importance of, first, outlining a future monitoring scheme by defining monitoring objectives in collaboration with clients and stakeholders to ensure the scheme is relevant and supported, taking into account existing knowledge and data.
The objectives are then translated into specific, measurable targets, with careful selection of indicators; 
a study design is developed that aligns the dimensioning of the scheme, as well as sampling and data collection strategies with the intended monitoring purpose;
costs are estimated. 
The focus is then shifted to the future output of a monitoring scheme. 
This includes planning the storage, processing and statistical analysis of the to be collected data, but also planning the reporting and communication of monitoring results.
Finally, the guidelines highlight the need for quality assurance and transparent documentation to maintain scientific credibility.
They also promote regular assessments and adaptive improvements based on new insights and changing information needs.


## Distinguishing different monitoring scopes {#sec-scopes}

In the present IAS context a number of distinct monitoring scopes can be identified, each reflecting different objectives and being relevant for different stages of invasion. We distinguish the scopes:

- Detection
- Distribution (change)
- Abundance (change)
- Distribution (change) under management
- Abundance (change) under management

An additional scope is introduced for situations where the current or potential distribution area of a species is largely unknown. In such cases, setting up a scheme to monitor (changes in) the distribution or abundance of a species is complicated by the fact that the monitoring area is partly unknown. The primary scope then becomes to systematically establish the (potential) distribution area of a species - which is referred to as:

- Inventory 

The choice of monitoring scope strongly influences the design of a monitoring scheme and is therefore an important first step in any concrete planning process. Below, we provide brief descriptions of each scope. We also summarize the key implications of the relevant legal frameworks discussed above - focusing primarily on the Invasive Alien Species Regulation, as the Flemish Species Decree remains comparatively generic in its provisions with regard to monitoring.

### Monitoring scope detection

A monitoring scheme with scope detection aims to assess a species' presence in a defined area from which the species is (largely) absent. 
Typically this encompasses areas at (and/or around) known places of (potential) introduction or sites of sporadic occurrence.
Other plausible options are areas at (and/or around) conservation sites, or areas from which the species had been eradicated before.

Detection receives considerable attention in the Invasive Alien Species Regulation. It is, for example, emphasized that prevention is “generally more environmentally desirable and cost-effective than reaction after the fact” [@noauthor_regulation_2014, p. 3] and should therefore be prioritized. Early detection and rapid response are widely recognized as pillars of effective IAS management, as they offer the best chance to contain or eradicate emerging populations before they become widespread and difficult to control (ref?). According to documentation supporting the regulation (@sec-terms-eu), detection can refer to both official inspections at points of entry - such as import controls, which in Belgium fall under the responsibility of the federal government (ref?) - or to monitoring of the natural environment for signs of new introductions. In this report, we focus on the latter, detecting emerging IAS populations in the wild in Flanders, as only this falls under INBO's monitoring obligations ([link](https://www.health.belgium.be/en/animals-and-plants/biodiversity/invasive-alien-species/anchoring-international-level-implementation), alternative ref?).


### Monitoring scope distribution

Under the scope distribution, a monitoring scheme aims to assess the status of and, where relevant, trend in a species' distribution. The area to be monitored will depend on the species’ current invasion stage. For species already widespread, this may require coverage of the entire Flemish region, while for species established more locally, monitoring can focus on their current range and the surrounding areas where spread is most likely. Setting up a monitoring scheme with this scope thus requires the (potential) distribution area of a species to be largely known a-priori.

Reconsidering the reporting obligations under the Invasive Alien Species Regulation, scope distribution can be considered the most well-defined from the EU perspective [@noauthor_regulation_2014 p. X]:
Distribution is explicitly operationalized as the presence and absence in terms of $10\times 10$ km grid cells of the EEA Reference grid [@peifer_about_2011] across Flanders. 


### Monitoring scope abundance

A monitoring scheme with the scope abundance [include definition] aims to assess the status of and, where relevant, trend in a species' population size. The monitoring area will typically encompass the species’ current distribution area . and surrounding regions where population changes are expected. It may also involve locations of particular interest, such as invasion hotspots or areas where management actions are being implemented. We discuss this latter special case under a distinct scope, namely abundance under management. 

Note that the Invasive Alien Species Regulation mentions the scope abundance only in the context of management evaluation. As with distribution monitoring, sufficient knowledge of the species’ distribution area is needed to define where abundance should be monitored.


### Monitoring scopes distribution or abundance under management

Monitoring schemes with scopes distribution or abundance under management aim to assess the status and possibly trend of a species' distribution or population size in and around areas where management takes place.
Management evaluation ranges on a continuum with as end points estimating causal effects of a measurement action versus measuring its temporal and spatial correlates. 
The degree of experimental and/or statistical control determines the position on this continuum.
In addition, the nature of the to-be-evaluated management action (e.g., eradication vs. population control) further defines the implementation of the management-related scopes:
If population control or containment measures are to be evaluated, the duration of monitoring will for instance be (potentially) unlimited.
If eradication measures are to be evaluated, monitoring will typically be of limited duration. Once monitoring has continued for a sufficiently long period without detections to confidently confirm the species’ eradication, it may be discontinued. In such cases, the focus may shift to periodic detection monitoring to ensure early warning in case of reintroduction.

The Invasive Alien Species Regulation considers distribution and abundance as possible outcomes under the monitoring of management, as well as possible side effects on non-target species and environment.


### Monitoring scope inventory

Monitoring the distribution or abundance of a species requires knowledge of the (potential) distribution area of a species, as we have explained in the previous subsections
If the (potential) distribution area is not sufficiently known then assessing its location forms a distinct monitoring scope called inventory [@de_knijf_monitoring_2014]. 
Under this scope, monitoring is of limited duration and can be finalized once the status of the distribution areas is sufficiently known. 
Note that “inventory” as used here refers specifically to targeted, time-limited efforts to determine a species’ distribution area, and differs from the broader use of the term in the Species Decree of the Flemish Government, where it includes a much wider range of monitoring objectives (see @sec-legal-context).
