## What is the level of sensitivity of this most relevant surveillance technique?

*The sensitivity indicates how well a method is able to detect the presence of a species or a minimally relevant (change in) population size. With a high sensitivity, the probability of detecting this presence is large if the species or a minimally relevant (change in) population size is actually present. A high sensitivity also leads to a small percentage of false-negative results. Choose one of the following options.*

- high sensitivity
- medium sensitivity
- low sensitivity
- unknown
- I do not know

*Optional: Briefly explain the answer chosen and indicate any sources used.*
