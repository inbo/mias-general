## Is there a standardised and optimised field protocol available?

*A standardised field protocol clearly defines the entire measurement procedure and thus ensures objectivity. An optimised field protocol contains information on optimal times and weather conditions for measuring a species, thus ensuring a sufficient and stable detection probability. Choose one of the following options.*

- yes
- yes, but the field protocol is only standardised
- yes, but the field protocol is only optimised
- no
- unknown
- I do not know

*Briefly explain the chosen answer (e.g. which field protocol is concerned). Also indicate the sources used.*
