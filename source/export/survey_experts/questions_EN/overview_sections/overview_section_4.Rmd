# Introduction & establishment

## How many current and potential introduction sites are there and how widespread are these?

*Introduction sites refer to locations related to routes through which the species enters Flanders, such as through transportation, trade, ornamental plants, domestic animals and other human activities. This also includes the natural spread of invasive populations from neighbouring countries into Flanders. Choose one of the following options.*

- limited number of specific locations (e.g. seaports)
- large number of widespread locations (e.g. freshwater bodies if the species is mainly released from aquaria)
- both specific and widespread locations
- unknown
- I do not know

*Optional: Briefly explain the chosen answer (e.g. which introduction sites are mainly concerned) and indicate any sources used.*
