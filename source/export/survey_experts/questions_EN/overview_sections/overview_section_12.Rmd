## What level of change in the current distribution sites can be expected within 10 years?

*This assessment takes into account factors such as the climate and habitat requirements of the species, the capacity of the species to spread in an area (dispersal capacity), and the expected further spread by human activity or from abroad into Flanders. Current or already planned management measures may also play a role. Choose one of the following options.*

- small change expected (few additional distribution sites)
- medium change expected (medium number of additional distribution sites)
- large change expected (many additional distribution sites, change in distribution pattern from local to widespread)
- unknown
- I do not know

*Optional: Briefly explain the answer chosen (e.g. which factors mainly determined the assessment) and indicate any sources used.*
