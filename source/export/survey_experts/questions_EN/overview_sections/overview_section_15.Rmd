# Impact

## What level of negative impact of the species can be expected on biodiversity and ecosystem services in Flanders?

*This question assumes that the species is or will be invasive and occupy suitable areas in Flanders. For species already present, this can be based on actual observed effects. For other species, the estimate may be based on similar situations in other countries, the ecology of the species, similarity to other invasive species, or other relevant factors. Choose one of the following options.*

- large negative impact expected
- medium negative impact expected
- small negative impact expected
- not applicable as species is unlikely to become invasive in Flanders within 10 years
- unknown
- I do not know

*Optional: Briefly explain the chosen answer (e.g. which impact mechanisms are mainly at play) and indicate any sources used.*
