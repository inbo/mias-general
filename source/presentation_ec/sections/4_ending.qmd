# Outlook

## Outlook

- Scaling up monitoring scheme development for remaining species
  - First designs as blueprints
  - Tackling species groups by capitalizing on synergies
  - Information compiled via expert survey
  - Drawing upon existing monitoring / citizen science initiatives

Zooming out - talking about how we can scale up scheme development
(bc seems like a lot of work - and it is)

- first designs as blueprints
- look at groups - survey method-based synergies - saves time during planning
- Survey information: starting point for monitoring design
  - limits search space during first phases which can otherwise be very time-consuming
- Result of phase 1 / 2: 
  - Drawing upon existing monitoring if it is suited 
  - Drawing on existing citizen science initiatives if structured monitoring is not feasible or urgent

[investment, but can pay off on the long-run]
