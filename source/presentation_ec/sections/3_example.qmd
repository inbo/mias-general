- In Flanders at early invasion stage (Antwerp population)
- one of few known populations on EU mainland 
- subject to management (eradication) by ANB

::: {.notes}

- small deer species native to China and Taiwan
- In Flanders the species is at an early invasion stage
- ... with an established population currently likely limited to parts of the province of Antwerp
- one of the few known populations on the EU mainland
- ... especially important that action is taken to prevent further spread within the EU
- this population is currently subject to eradication measures coordinated by the Agency for Nature and Forests

## Prioritising information needs {background-image="../../media/presentation_ec/symbol_1.png" background-size="5%" background-position="top 30px right 50px"} 


Monitoring scopes refined:

- Confirm population decline/eradication
  - Abundance under management - trend
  - Abundance under management - status
- Detection of (re-)introduced/left-over individuals
  - Presence under management - status
  - Presence after management - status


<!-- []{.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=1} -->


::: {.notes}

Focussing on the established population, we refine monitoring scopes from survey,
based on further expert consultations

- first 2: confirming population decline/eradication under management
- last 2: detection and I'd like to focus on these now

- Presence under management is important, because
  - While eradication is going on, the species might evade the measures taken and spread into buffer area around distribution area 
  - we want to be able to detect that to contain further spread

- Presence after management
  - Once eradication has been successfully completed, we need to follow it up, to make sure species remains absent
  - in case left-over of re-introduced animals in above distribution area we want to know this as well

## Developing sample design and data collection {background-image="../../media/presentation_ec/symbol_2.png" background-size="5%" background-position="top 30px right 50px"}

Sample frame & representative sample of locations

![](../../media/presentation_ec/plot_dist_sample.png){width=780 fig-align="center"}


::: {.notes}

For these monitoring scopes we need to decide on:

- sample frame 
  - where do we *potentially* want to place camera traps: most-suited technique
- how to draw a representative sample of locations from this sample frame

- here: possible sample frame for distribution area
- concerns all areas that qualify as potential habitat within the distribution area (green)
- sample that is representative in the sense that it is spatially balanced

Optimal sample size for detection

- Aim detection: detect species with a [high probability]{style="text-decoration:underline"} if it is [present]{style="text-decoration:underline"}
  - high probability: e.g., 90 %
  - present: animals present at, e.g., 1 % of all possible locations
  - statistical test: Binomial test ($\alpha$ = 10 %)


::: {.notes}

We also need to decide on sample size: 

- Aim detection: we want to be able to detect the species with a high prob if present.
  - Want to know at how many locations do we need to actually place cameras to do that.
- We can analyse this a-priori to data collection, but for that we need to define/fix a few things:
  - high detection prob. of design: 90% 
  - presence: animals present at 5 or 1 % of all possible locations
    - 5 or 1 animal per 100 locations
- statistical test use to test for presence 

Then we can run our analysis

[at least 1 animal -> also a percentage relative to the number of all possible locations; a small one, most likely...]
[- if we want to be certain that they are absent than we need to check all possible locations]

::: {.notes}

Here is the result:

- clear relationship between the minimal presence we can detect with our sample and the sample size
- if species is present at 1% of locations then we can detect this with a 90% probability using a sample of 230 locations
- if we obtain 230 zero-observations, it is 'plausible' that the probability of presence is small enough (smaller than 1 %)
- Species probably not present (=absent) in the 1% sense

[- Optimal sample size: the one that is just large enough to detect the 'presence of interest']
[- because we do want to get a precise answer, but we don't want to waste resources or impact on nature more than necessary]

```


::: {.notes}

- Costs can be included into the analysis by 
  - roughly translating the number of locations into associated costs
- the trade off between sensitivity and budget becomes explicit 
- know how much sensitivity we would need to give up for to stick to a certain budget
- decide whether that is acceptable in terms of sensitivity
