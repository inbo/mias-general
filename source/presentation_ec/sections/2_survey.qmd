# Expert survey

::: {.notes}

For this reason, we first took a step back and 
conducted an expert survey to prepare the application of the guidelines

:::

## Purpose

- Draw on expert knowledge & assessment of situation in Flanders
  - introduction & establishment
  - distribution & abundance
  - impacts
  - monitoring
  - management
- Assess [feasiblity]{style="text-decoration:underline"} and [urgency]{style="text-decoration:underline"} of monitoring schemes per species
- Prioritize Union List (candidate) IAS for monitoring in Flanders

- So, we relied on species experts for their knowledge and assessment of the situation in Flanders,
regarding a number of aspects
- with the idea that experts would know the relevant info and could help us integrating it in an efficient way
- survey question were selected such that they's serve as indicators of feasibility & urgency of structured monitoring per species
- collected responses were summarized/condensed into feasibility & urgency scores
- and subsequently used for prioritzation...

[why survey: we wanted answers to specific questions relevant for monitoring and the situation in Flanders]

- For the prioritization itself we took the following approach
- Propose (exhaustive) range of monitoring scopes, e.g.,
    - detection, distribution (change), abundance (change) under management
- then used the overall feasibilty and urgency scores
  - but also scores on individual questions (e.g. invasion stage, management status)
- to determine relevance & importance/priority of each species scope combination based on survey results

... more specifically, to prioritize the species with respect to different possible monitoring scopes

- result: selection of species-monitoring scope combinations eligible for development of mon schemes in near future

- our results presented to a steering committee involving representatives of 
  - the Agency for Nature and Forests
  - Flanders Environment Agency
- Steering committee made final selection of species & monitoring scopes (here)
- focus on the Chinese muntjac, 
- ...for which we have some preliminary phase 1 and 2 results
- ...to give a bit of an impression of how guidelines are applied
