# Expert survey

## Purpose

- Prioritize 88 + 34 IAS for monitoring in Flanders
- Draw on expert knowledge & assessment of situation in Flanders
  - introduction & establishment
  - distribution & abundance
  - impacts
  - monitoring
  - management
- Assess **feasiblity** and **urgency** of monitoring schemes per species

- Expert support/prepare the development of a coherent IAS monitoring program in Flanders
- 88 + 34 (candidate) IAS on union list - some kind of prioritization needed
  - covered the previous Union List plus candidate species (X of which have now been added to the list)
- we wanted specific information and judgements about the situation in Flanders
- assumed experts would know relevant documents
- collected responses condensed into overall ratings of feasibility & urgency of structured monitoring schemes for the considered species

## Prioritization 

![Flowchart of the exclusion process](../../media/survey/flowchart-prioritization.svg){width=700}


::: {.notes}

- For the prioritization itself we took the following approach
  - Propose (exhaustive) range of monitoring scopes, e.g.,
    - detection, distribution (change), abundance (change) under management
  - determine relevance & importance/priority of each species scope combination based on survey results
  - criteria: 
    - overall feasibilty and urgency scores
    - but also scores on individual questions (e.g. invasion stage, management status)

- Result
  - selection of species-scope combinations for near-future monitoring scheme development


- Results presented in different formats
  - Overview tables listing exclusion reasons for all species-scope combinations, primary methods for relevant combinations 
  - Scenario's to further structure the results
       - focus on selected scopes and species for which these are relevant according to our survey
       - explore commonalities in monitoring methods between species (method-based synergies for planning and implementation)
- Results presented to a steering committee consisting of project team & representatives of 
  - the Agency for Nature and Forests
  - Flanders Environment Agency
- Final species selection made by steering committee
