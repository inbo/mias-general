- Phase 1, mainly:
  - Analysing the demand and supply of
  - reviewing the scientific basis (focus on aspects relevant for monitoring),
  - (constraints analysis)
  - outlining a future monitoring scheme by defining monitoring objectives in collaboration with clients and stakeholders
  - ensure the scheme is relevant and supported, taking into account existing knowledge and data

- Phase 2:
  - monitoring objectives are then translated into specific, measurable targets; selection of suitable indicators
  - Sample frame and sampling to draw representative
  - How much data to collect: align dimensioning of the scheme with its purpose
  - Measurement (e.g., protocols)
  - Determining costs

- Phase 3:
  - The focus is then shifted to the future output of a monitoring scheme
  - planning the storage, processing and statistical analysis of the to be collected data


- Phase 4:
  - planning the reporting and communication of monitoring results


- Phase 5:
  - Approval & start of monitoring network design
  - guidelines highlight the need for quality assurance and transparent documentation to maintain scientific credibility
  - regular assessments and adaptive improvements based on new insights and changing information needs
  
  - Documentation monitoring scheme
  - High-quality data collection and storage
  - Monitoring network control and evaluation
