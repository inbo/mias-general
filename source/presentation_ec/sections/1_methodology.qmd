# Guidelines for monitoring design

## Purpose

- Support the design of policy-oriented monitoring schemes
  - Tailoring monitoring schemes to the actual information needs
  - Producing results of high substantive & numerical quality

- guidelines for monitoring design were developed at INBO based on the relevant scientific lit
- purpose, in a nutshell, is to support the design of policy‐oriented monitoring schemes
- with a focus on
- ... tailoring a scheme to the actual information needs
- ... to produce results of high substantive and numerical quality

- So, the monitoring questions should be answered 
  - with a high precision & reliably

The guidelines distinguish 5 different phases

- Phase 1...
- should in the end lead to clearly formulated monitoring objectives and a rough outline of the design
- achieved by taking into account the information demand from different stakeholders, 
  existing monitoring, scientific background information (on species and monitoring)  

- In phase 2...
  - monitoring objectives are tied to quantifiable outcomes, then
  - the sampling design is planned, 
  - ...as well as data collection (implementation monitoring techniques)
  - costs are estimated

- Phase 3 then concerns...
  - the storage, processing and statistical analysis of the to be collected data

- Phase 4 involves...
  - planning the reporting and communication of the monitoring results

- And the final phase 5:
  - the actual implementation of scheme, after its approval
  - continued documentation & evaluation

::: {.notes}

- The way in which we follow these phases is a circular process, where
- one in which one iterate through the different phases,
- continuously refining the design 
- until it's ready for implementation

## Application challenges

- Knowledge transfer
- Determining information needs / monitoring scopes
- ...
- 88 (+ 34 candidate) Union List IAS,<br>but no clear prioritization / strategy


::: {.notes}

- guidelines have successfully been applied, for instance in the context of the EU habitats and birds directives
- Nevertheless, we did experience a number of challenges
- ...with the most important one being that...
- ...we are dealing with a long list of species (at that point still 88 union list and 34 candidate species) 
- ... but no clear prioritization, no clear strategy of how to address this long list
- (... and how to address monitoring design for this long list)

[- Also: needed some initial information per species as a starting point]
